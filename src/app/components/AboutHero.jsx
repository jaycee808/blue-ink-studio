                At the core of Blue Ink Studio is a belief in thoughtful development and design. Whether it’s a brand launch, portfolio site, or something entirely new, every project is crafted with care and clarity. Turning ideas into identities that feel distinct, honest, and bold.

                Hello, I’m Jamie – the designer, developer, and creative mind behind Blue Ink Studio. With a background in front-end development and a deep love for visual storytelling, I built this studio to merge technical skills with expressive, purpose-led design.

            <p>
                I believe great design is built on structure, intention, and a little experimentation. Every project begins with a conversation about your goals, your audience, and what makes your brand tick. From there, I move through a collaborative process that blends clean code, bold visuals, and purposeful layout choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                I draw inspiration from Swiss graphic design, editorial layouts, and bold visuals. Every project is tailored to suit your brand’s voice. Whether it’s creating a visual identity from scratch or refining an existing one, I focus on making sure every detail has a reason for being there.

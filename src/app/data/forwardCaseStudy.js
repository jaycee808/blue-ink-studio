        context:
        "4WARD2GETHER is a Scottish charity supporting community development, inclusion, and creative expression. I originally built their first website with a bespoke WordPress theme, but for the redesign I wanted to push further: creating a playful, modern identity that reflects their mission of bringing people together. The existing site worked functionally but felt restrictive in terms of design. The charity wanted something more colourful, engaging, and representative of their values. I saw an opportunity to introduce bold visuals, vibrant gradients, and interactive elements while keeping usability and accessibility central.",
        goal:
        "Redesign the website to be modern, inclusive, and engaging, while improving storytelling and usability.",

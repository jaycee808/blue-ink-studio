            Metrica is a vibrant e-commerce site for an abstract art collection. Metrica merges bold colours and textured gradients with clean type and layout systems, creating a visual contrast that echoes the artwork itself. Built with storytelling and scalability in mind, the site includes a full collection structure, gallery views, and individual product pages. Each crafted to let the work speak for itself.
